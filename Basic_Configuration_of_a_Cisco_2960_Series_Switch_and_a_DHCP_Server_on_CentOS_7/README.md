# Lab 3: Basic Configuration of a Cisco 2960 Series Switch and a DHCP Server on CentOS 7

## Description
This lab focuses on the basic configuration of a Cisco 2960 series switch and setting up a DHCP server on a CentOS 7 machine. The objectives are to verify the operation of APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) and a DHCP server for assigning IP addresses in a LAN environment with Windows hosts.

## Objectives
1. Verify the correct operation of the APIPA protocol for assigning IP addresses without an active DHCP server in the LAN for physical Windows machines.
2. Verify the correct operation of a physical DHCP server and assign IP addresses in the LAN for physical Windows machines.

## Requirements
- Console cable
- Cisco ws-c2960-24tc-s
- Host with CentOS 7
- 3 hosts with Windows
- PuTTY (or any terminal emulator)
- DHCP package installed on CentOS 7
- Cisco Packet Tracer or another network simulation tool
